# Scale Workout Builder plugin for MuseScore 3.x
*Scale Workout Builder plugin for MuseScore 3.x* is a plugin for MuseScore 3.0 for the creation of exercises and workouts scores for practising your playing skills and knowledge of scales, improvisation patterns, ...

## New features in 2.3.0
* In Grid mode, build patterns in the notes defined by the current chord (e.g. loop among C,Eb,G,A,Bb for a "Cm6" chord)
* New "Bass instrument" (*)
* Store the last used settings

(*) Due to limitations in the MuseScore API, the plugin is not able to add the F-clef. The user must add it manually. However, the patterns are transposed accordingly to a F-clef. 
## Features
* Choose workout type between *Scale mode* or *Grid mode*
* Select the instrument transposition (Concert Pitch, Bb, Bass, ...)
* Define freely up-to 8 patterns of up-to 12 steps each
* Loop them across the diatonic scale, or by triads
* Repeat the patterns over different roots (*Scale mode*)
* Export as a MuseScore score
